# SMS Spam Detection Model

## Overview:

This repository hosts a machine learning model specialized in detecting spam in SMS messages. Leveraging a dataset of labeled SMS texts, the model distinguishes between spam and legitimate messages.
Efficient SMS spam detection is crucial for maintaining the security and user experience of mobile communication.

## Features:

- Dataset: Trained on a comprehensive dataset of labeled SMS messages, ensuring relevance to real-world scenarios.

- Model Architecture: The SMS spam detection model is built using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- It employs Naive Bayes for classification, optimized for the characteristics of SMS data.

- Evaluation Metrics: The model's performance is assessed using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, specifically tailored to SMS spam detection.
## The model will predict whether the input SMS text is spam or not.

## Evaluation:

The model's performance on the test set of SMS messages is as follows:

- Accuracy: [97%]
- Precision: [ham : 1.00, spam: 0.72]
- Recall: [96%]
- F1 Score: [0.98]
